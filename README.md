# WiFi-Temporal-Activity-Detection
A model aims to handle wifi temporal activity Detection

## Abstract
The code of WiFi based Temporal Activity Detection via Dual Pyramid.

## Getting Started

### Environment



We recommend to install Python 3.8 and pytorch 1.12.1: 

`pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116`

Other packages required to support this project can be installed by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setup

build the project package manager: `python3 setup.py develop`

### Training and Tnference
you can run the TALFi in terminal by: `bash WiFiTAD/train_tools/tools.sh 0,1,2,3`
